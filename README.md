# CPP

Overview

This repository showcases my complete progress through all nine C++ modules, covering the full spectrum of modern C++ — from the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to templates, STL, and algorithms.
Each module built on the previous one, strengthening design, abstraction, and performance skills.

📘 Modules Overview
Module 00 – Basics & Classes

Intro to C++ syntax and class fundamentals.
Practiced encapsulation, constructors, destructors, and class structure.

Module 01 – Memory & File Handling

Focused on pointers, references, and file streams.
Managed dynamic memory and worked with input/output operations.

Module 02 – Operator Overloading

Applied ad-hoc polymorphism and overloading.
Customized class behavior through function and operator overloading.

Module 03 – Inheritance

Learned code reusability through class hierarchies.
Built base and derived classes with different access levels.

Module 04 – Polymorphism & Abstraction

Developed runtime polymorphism and abstract interfaces.
Used virtual functions, pure virtual methods, and dynamic dispatch.

Module 05 – Exceptions

Introduced robust error handling in OOP design.
Worked with try/catch, exception safety, and class interactions.

Module 06 – Casting

Explored type conversions and safe casting.
Used static, dynamic, and reinterpret casts with class hierarchies.

Module 07 – Templates

Introduced generic programming for reusable code.
Created class and function templates with specialization.

Module 08 – STL & Containers

Worked extensively with the C++ Standard Template Library.
Used vectors, lists, maps, iterators, and standard algorithms.

Module 09 – Algorithms

Final project combining all previous concepts.
Implemented template-based sorting algorithms (Ford–Johnson) and performance benchmarking.
